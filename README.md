# PC Parts List
I created this when I was planning to build a new PC. A local reseller kept a Google Sheet with his inventory
and I wanted to monitor it for any price changes.

## TODO
- [x] Pull each item and its price per category I'm interested in from the table
- [ ] Add most recent price to a db table
- [ ] Send alert if any item's price changes (email/slack/sms?) - Look into Apprise
- [ ] Dockerize it
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Figure out where it should run from
